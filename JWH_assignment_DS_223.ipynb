If you’re doing a multi-class classification problem — such as whether a waterpump is functional, functional needs repair, or nonfunctional — then use a categorical encoding that works for multi-class classification, such as [OrdinalEncoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/ordinal.html) (not [TargetEncoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/targetencoder.html))\n",

    "- In additon to `RandomizedSearchCV`, scikit-learn has [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html).

    "> You can even go further in combining GridSearchCV and Pipeline: it is also possible to search over the actual steps being performed in the pipeline (say whether to use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler). This leads to an even bigger search space and should be considered carefully. Trying all possible solutions is usually not a viable machine learning strategy. However, here is an example comparing a RandomForestClassifier and an SVC ...\n",
